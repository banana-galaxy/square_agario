### installing everything you need to run the game
You can see installation instructions here: <http://arcade.academy/installation.html>
<br>The website is also **the** main arcade website and it's amazing

You will also need to install the dataclasses library which arcade needs
> pip3 install dataclasses

### enjoy!
just run the new_client.py file. The game is a work in progress so I'll be adding changes to it every once in a while. The game window is 2000 pixels in height and width, and window resizing is not enabled at this point so the window may be too large for some screens.

This is also my first time working with github so I'm still trying to figure it all out.
