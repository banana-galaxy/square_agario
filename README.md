### installing everything you need to run the game
You can see installation instructions here: <http://arcade.academy/installation.html>
<br>The website is also **the** main arcade website and it's amazing

You will also need to install the dataclasses library which arcade needs
> pip3 install dataclasses

### enjoy!
just run the new_client.py file. The game is a work in progress so I'll be adding changes to it every once in a while.

This is also my first time working with github so I'm still trying to figure it all out.
