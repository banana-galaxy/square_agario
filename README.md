# square_agario

### installing everything you need to run the game
You can see installation instructions here: <http://arcade.academy/installation.html>
<br>The website is also **the** main arcade website and it's amazing

You will also need to install the dataclasses library which arcade needs
> pip3 install dataclasses

### enjoy!
#### game
just run the new_client.py file. The game is a work in progress so I'll be adding changes to it every once in a while.

#### bugs
The game will freeze if your square gets really close to the map size. It's "normal" as in that's exactly how it's intended to be because I have not finished that part completely yet so the game doesn't freeze. Basically it's a known bug, and will be fixed.
<br>Another known bug is that the square changes its position on the map when you resize the window.

#### discord
I created a discord server for this game just for fun, you're welcome to join if you want: <https://discord.gg/q3eVxNQ>

#### some other info
This is also my first time working with github so I'm still trying to figure it all out.
